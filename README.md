# TDT4173
TDT4173: Machine learning project


## Running the application using jupyter notebook
To run the application you will need the required library as well as python 3. Install python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Python 3.9 is currently not supported by all libraries so we recommend python 3.8. After installing python you could download all requirements using:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` 

Or: ``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ``` depending on allready installed versions of python.

Then you have to start the Jupyter Notebook using the command: 

```jupyter notebook ```
